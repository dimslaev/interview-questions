### Define Javascript

JavaScript is a lightweight, single-threaded, and interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

- Single-threaded - it has one call stack and one memory heap. It must finish executing a piece of code before moving onto the next one.
- Interpreted - JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program written in C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run.
- Object-oriented - refers to using self-contained pieces of code (objects, functions) that can interact between each other to develop applications
