### Define Javascript

JavaScript is a single-threaded, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities which allows to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

- Single-threaded - it must finish executing a piece of code before moving onto the next one.
- Interpreted - as opposed to compiled language (eg. C++, Java) which needs to be compiled before it can be run.
- Object-oriented - refers to using self-contained pieces of code (objects, functions) that can interact between each other to develop applications.
